# SDS Update to v12

## Introduction

SDS v12 is a mandatory update, if you run a SDS node for Stratos, you have to apply this update in order for your node to continue normal operations.

v12 brings a large number of updates and new features. See <a href="https://github.com/stratosnet/sds/releases/tag/v0.12.4" target="_blank">Changelog</a> for detailed info.

---

## Stop node

First of all, you should stop the `ppd` executable. Either press Ctrl + C in the running tmux, or simply run:

```shell
killall -2 ppd
```

---

## Compile new binary

- Remove the existing directory (if existing):

```shell
cd $HOME
rm -rf sds
```

---

- Get the new release

```shell
git clone https://github.com/stratosnet/sds.git
cd sds
git checkout tags/v0.12.4
go clean -modcache
make build
```

---

## Replace existing binary

If you followed the full guide, you should have your `ppd` binary installed in `$HOME/bin/ppd` so we need to replace it with the new one:

```shell
cd $HOME
cp sds/target/* $HOME/bin/
```

---

## Test new version

Make sure the newly installed `ppd` binary is up to date:

```shell
ppd version
```
Should return: `v0.12.4`

---

## Edit config file

Automatically update and verify your current configuration file:

---

- Enter your node folder. Eg:

```shell
cd /path/to/rsnode1
```

- Run the config update command:

```shell
ppd config update
```

Expected output:

```
[INFO] config.go:122: Updated config version from v0.11.9 to v0.12.4
[INFO] config.go:128: Deleted entry node.auto_start = true
[INFO] config.go:128: Deleted entry node.connectivity.allow_owner_rpc = false
[INFO] config.go:135: Added entry keys.beneficiary_address =
[INFO] config.go:135: Added entry node.connectivity.rpc_namespaces = user
```

!!! tip ""

    `beneficiary_address` has been added for miners that operate multiple nodes, from multiple wallets, that would like to receive all rewards to a single wallet address. You can use the same wallet as `wallet_address` if you want.

## Start the node

You can now restart your `ppd` binary as explained in the <a href="https://docs.thestratos.org/docs-resource-node/setup-and-run-a-sds-resource-node/#run-sds-resource-node" target="_blank">full guide</a>.
