    - Stratos is a decentralized data mesh for blockchain, it defines the next generation of decentralized computing services that can serve dAPPs, allowing smart contract developers to use decentralized infrastructure to deploy, store and execute their code and data.

    - The core objective of Stratos is to establish a distributed network ecosystem encompassing infrastructure providers, middleware developers, and dApp creators. 

    - This collaboration is driven by shared development, value-sharing, and efficient dedication to providing dependable, cost-effective applications, fostering the thriving landscape of blockchain applications. 

    - Stratos is committed to creating an unassailable environment for all dApps, ensuring the durability and reliability of applications.
